# Welcome to my first development game

This is a small game that I am developing using only lines of code in java, without future sale purposes, just for fun.

## About the game

The game is about a narrative story where the gameplay is based on everyday mini-games. Some of these minigames are:

- Guess a number
- Rock, paper and scissors
- Trivial
- Much more!
